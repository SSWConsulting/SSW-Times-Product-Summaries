Hi all and welcome to the Tina Cloud Ant
Tina CMS Sprint R90 review and retro and
the Sprint 91 forecast. So first we'll
be going through the review.
So for our sprint goals, we had uh the
search docs and video finished. So Jack
got the search docs done and he has uh
finished his V1 uh version uh yeah
version one of the video. Um but we he
hasn't got that video uh released yet.
So still working on that. And uh for
myself and we have been working on the
media management uh indexing. Uh
unfortunately we haven't got around to
uh the actual um new indexing process
yet that we need to have in place before
we seed the uh indexes. So that is still
in progress.
So for Tenic Cloud, we had 135 hours
built to myself, Brooke, Matt, Ivan,
Kaha, and Josh.
And for uh Tennis MS, we had 68 uh.5
hours build to Jack, Ivan, Isaac, and
Hawk.
>> Okay. If uh Kaha is in the team now,
where is he today?
>> You've got him on client work.
>> Oh, he's on client work. Okay.
>> You asked him to do that.
>> Okay.
>> For the sprint backlog, uh key things to
note was uh we uh deployed a fix for the
search that was raised in Discord. Uh
but that was raised in Discord, so that
was out relatively quick. got that
resolved. Um, and some UI UX
improvements for the uh, organization
project breadcrumb. So, some nice UI
changes that we can show here. So, this
is the before of the top banner in Tener
Cloud. Uh, you can see that there's a
bit of uh, alignment issues with the um,
dash there. But if we go to the new, you
can see that's all been cleaned up. Um
we took off the link to make that a
little uh less um intense of a header.
Uh but yeah,
great changes there by Josh.
Uh moving on.
Uh for the sprint burnup, we had uh 60
uh remaining and 16 completed.
For uh production deployments, we had
one deployment for Tina Cloud and one
release for Tennis CMS.
The application health overview
timeline. Uh for the identity API 500s,
we seen an increase from 12 to 91. Um in
the overall scheme of things of 2.5
million requests, that it wasn't too big
of a jump. uh but um I did do some
investigation into that and it was just
around some uh GitHub uh token uh
validation that I'm investigating
and for the content uh HTP 500's we seen
an increase from 1K to 3K uh yeah still
the issues with the um rules project
that we still need to work on um
issues open and closed for Tennis CMS
MS. Uh, last month we had 18 issues
opened and 15 closed. This month we had
15 open and three closed.
>> Uh, passing over to Matt.
>> Yep. So, uh, last week Tina Cloud
tracked 6,500 odd uh, commits which is
an increase from about 5,300 last week.
In terms of the orgs being created, um
it went up a little bit. So it went from
88 orgs to 95 orgs in the last week. And
we can see that that um that trend is
pretty consistent. The last 30 days, um
the projects created are going up and so
are the organizations. So it's going in
the right direction. for our user
onboarding funnel. Um, we increased our
user onboarding from 6% to 8.5% and
collaborator onboarding from 16% to 36%.
The other cool thing on here is uh Post
Hog has actually surfaced this the
yellow button ask users why uh which
kicks in some AI in case we want to um
start up a survey and ask ask them why
they didn't complete the the onboarding.
So, we're going to be looking into that
uh later down the track.
In terms of our starter repositories, uh
our starter templates, uh TINA Barebones
starter went up from 33 to 37 clones.
NextJS starter went up from 54 to 58
clones. Uh our selfest demo went down
slightly from 23 to 20 clones in the
last 2 weeks.
package downloads. Uh big uptick with um
a new release and our downloads
increased from about 29,000 to just over
40,000. So we finally cracked that
40,000 barrier in a week.
>> Well done.
>> Epic's progress uh remains consistent.
terms of um R&D uh there wasn't any
notable R&D work this week. Uh our AI
tools again lots of use of GitHub
Copilot and uh Yak Shaver.
>> Um can I just ask about consumption? Who
is using the most? Who's getting clo
close to or seeing their consumption
where they kind of get blocked?
Yeah, I I definitely
>> Okay, so Sam.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. Can we put I know Sam's not really
on this, but can we add him, so that's
good.
Sam,
>> who else? Who else is close? Yeah, Ivon.
Okay.
>> Yeah, I I used my um code limit um
yesterday.
>> Okay, so you're all right. So, you're
hitting your limits. So um
>> who is the gold standard in setting off
agents and stuff?
>> No
team
>> gold standard don't know
>> in this team or in general
>> in in this team who is the gold standard
who I don't know before they leave for
lunch sets off something so it's kicked
off like working
working well with the the AI agents.
I'm mostly just using clawed code for
and then just sending that off. I don't
have like heaps of agents going off or
whatever. I don't know. Ivan, you've got
a few things going on AI tools wise. Do
you got uh got anything to share?
>> Yeah, I usually just leave perplexity on
research and things and then copilot
just chipping away at something while
I'm working on some other code. warp is
just terminal stuff. So it doesn't
really have the same tendency I guess
just helps you with commands in the
command line.
>> Right. Okay. So uh I don't know if the
team agrees that Ivan's using it the
best. Can we move up to the top or put a
star next to him so people know that? Um
>> not always the most.
>> Yeah. Look, I kind of consider if we're
if everyone's hitting their limits on
consumption of AI, then we want to look
at that problem next.
>> Well, I would probably say that Jack
would be first because he wiped up an
entire CMS version in the last what week
or two. So, I think that must be up
there somewhere.
>> Well, let's put the king emoji next to
Jack if that's what you think. on this
topic. Actually, I'd be um I'd be keen
to see what you thought about injecting
Caluman for a week.
>> Yeah.
>> Painting client work
>> and just working out the gap between
what everyone's doing and what he's
doing.
>> And Gordon are doing specs in hours.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> You know, and and clients in days.
>> What's the gap? And how can we help that
each team member?
>> Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's a good idea.
Okay. Yeah. Just as a
>> just as a note for that idea, um just
remember the levels that people are at.
So obviously a solution to two a pair of
solution architects using AI, you're
taking a bazooka and then multiplying it
by 100. Whereas if you've got a junior
developer and you multiply it by 100,
you don't get that big a jump. So
there's that to be taken into account,
too.
>> Yeah, that's right.
>> Um
>> Sam, what were you using for your AI?
Open code and shiver.
>> Open code. Is that one word?
>> Yeah,
>> this is the only
uh the only person using Claude here is
Eli. That's unusual compared with other
teams. Most people are finding Claude
the best by by a substantial mile. So,
uh,
>> gives you access to all the models.
>> Yeah, I think we're all using boards
models.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. Oh, sorry. Okay.
>> These are just like the different
clients, so I getting access to those
models. Yeah.
>> Okay. All right.
>> I generally use the cloud 4.5, Opus or
Gemini free and copilot CLI just has
access to all of them and it's a bit
daunting to use it inside the ID in
comparison to a CLI.
All right,
to continue on
>> for the co-pilot stats,
um, we had quite a few speakers,
including some unknown speakers.
>> One, two, and threes.
>> Whoever background noise it picked up
would be my assumption.
>> Yeah, I think it I think it is the
background noise.
that speaker one lines up with Brooke.
>> Yeah.
>> So,
>> it's probably probably Sam in the
background.
>> Um,
yeah, but anyway, the speaking summary
showed that yeah, I did most of the
talking with Matt just behind. Got a few
few marks there. Um
the main item completed the I AI thought
was making the max line width
configurable.
Um
guess it wasn't too many like main items
that we were completing. So
>> we certainly spoke about that one the
most. So that's most probably
>> probably you put a tick on or a cross on
it if it's right or wrong or what do you
do with that data?
Adam, if if the if the co-pilot stat is
right or wrong, do you put a ticker
across on it or
>> uh Oh, that's a good idea. You could put
a ticker, but it's good.
>> Isn't that what your outcome is?
>> That's what the goal is. So, if you feel
good. Yep. Great.
Uh, now before we move on to the
retrospective, where's the claude um
stats?
>> Can bring that up.
>> Yeah, put it in. put it um above the
co-pilot stuff just a link to it. Okay.
So um Manny, do you want to take us
through this
or I can I guess uh the meeting summary
was efficient.
Um the key point was
>> Tina Cloud Ron
>> was yeah Matt stated stats say no one
logs into Tina cloud that's a critical
product health indicator that was used
to justify deprioritization
rather than triggering an investigation.
Uh so the key decisions made were to
prioritize media management and rules
telemetry over any UI fixes, test
staging before Tina cloud, uh do V4 UX
with Michaela Jack to monitor Discord
for this sprint and defer playright
upgrade. Oh, interesting. All right,
scroll down.
Uh keep going. Hard truth. The team's
building features for a product with
near zero engagement. Tina cloud
uh performance issues are being measured
rather than fixed. Telemetry alone
doesn't solve 4 second search problems.
>> It's taking stuff out of context.
>> Yeah. Okay. Uh we'll correct it as we
go. Uh capacity is unreliable due to the
client work being pulled away
unpredictably and V4 will accumulate
deferred UX decisions until it becomes
overwhelming. Go to the top. a bold
statement.
>> And the next timeline shows Eli did most
the talking, then Matt, then Jack. Same
type of thing. Scroll down.
Okay,
keep going.
Okay, keep going. And there's a little
bit of wastage. Next. Let's go to next
one.
And people on rolls. It thinks Eli is
the scrum master. Just worked that out
from the chat. says you do too much
talking. 45% of speaking time is
procedural. Trust people will see the
board rather than reading titles aloud.
Matt Wixs, they think he's the product
owner and the tech lead. He's the high
Australian contributor. The no one logs
into Tina cloud data point is brutal but
important. Keep sharing those hard
truths.
Okay. What to say about Jack? He's a
dev. He's It's good that you flag the
600 latency league with data like that
more often. Calvin, your calendar manage
but needs work. This is what he doesn't
look at his calendar. Okay,
Brook
most efficient communicator. Every
statement contains useful information.
Don't be afraid to speak up more,
Brooke. Uh Ivonne, good collaboration
instinct with the review offer. be more
specific about what's blocking progress
on examples. Don't just say I'm blocked,
>> Isaac.
>> I didn't even say I blocked. That's
really weird.
>> It also says don't be defensive.
>> Isaac, your update was solid when you
got to speak. Push through the I'm not
sure if I'm needed mindset. Was
distracted dur during your own item
discussion. Whoa, brutal. All right,
keep going down. Down, down. All right,
next. What's the next one?
Insights. What's that? Elephants in the
room. Tina cloud usage. Got Matt. We got
a lot of mileage out of that one
statement.
>> Mhm.
>> BI plan B vi B4 planning is happening in
solar solos.
>> Yeah, solos. Sorry. Uh, scroll down
and
uh all the same type of thing. Isaac is
disengaged on his own item. What is
>> I don't know how it's decided that but
>> he must have started talking then said
I'm bored of myself. Okay. Not sure.
>> All right. Next one.
Uh analytics. Uh good good. Scroll down.
I said car was here a little while.
Okay. Next.
And trends. Anything recurring issues.
searched. Oh, yeah. Search is recurring.
That's for sure. I wonder if I wonder
how it knows that since Oh, because it
knows you've been tracking it for a long
time. Okay. Keep going.
Predictions.
Okay.
All right. Good. That's great. Uh, good
code is amazing.
>> In comparison with the last week, this
one is rubbish. Complete rubbish. Most
of that is incorrect.
>> Yeah.
>> Complete. What other everything was
wrong or you
>> about 80% of that was taken out of
context so bad.
>> Yeah, there's some weird stuff in this
one I think.
>> Example
>> uh example discussion about the V4
needing Michaela but that was before we
had a discussion with Michaela. So it's
not happening in silos. We just needed a
designer before we started actually
discussing stuff.
>> So that's completely out of context.
Yeah.
>> Then
yeah, the search indexing stuff, the
same thing. We got to the bottom of
this. Yeah, my stuff with um examples. I
gave a daily update. I didn't say I was
blocked. I just said I'm making
progress. So, it didn't go down. It took
it as a
something weird. So with V4, do you guys
agree to, you know, get it get it up and
running and then give it to a designer
to check the UX flow and improve the
>> Absolutely not.
>> I don't think that was ever the plan.
That's misinterpreted that.
>> The problem is you're getting a designer
who doesn't really know the product and
has to learn it. And I I'm not certain
that's a like that's gonna burn a lot of
time. Like I'd prefer to see one of you
guys get it up and running.
>> We've Yeah, but we've already we've
already done that. So Jack has already
>> um
>> done done a cut of the UI. Now we're
getting Michaela to look over it and
make sure it still makes sense so that
like all the navigation stuff is
together and laid out logically and it
doesn't feel like you have to your eyes
have to bounce around to do things.
>> All right. If the UI is done and a dev
has checked it and given a test pass
like on the flow, can we get a video
made of that before we give it to
Michaela?
>> Well, we've already given it to
Michaela,
>> right?
>> I don't trust a dev's decision at all
when it comes to designing. I would
rather Michaela get with TGO as Thgo
uses it every day and then those two
vibe it out. Yeah, maybe in this case
they do use it, but in a lot of cases
designers don't know the application and
then true if they're doing it early,
they're trying to become a BA, which I
don't think is
>> uh true. But I half agree with you. Um
when Michaela was playing around with
Time Pro,
>> she made a change come and saw came and
saw me cuz I was the one actually using
it
>> and often times it wasn't quite right.
It wasn't quite intuitive. So I would
give us direction, she would make the
change. Right.
>> It was a very quick flight.
>> So,
>> yeah, but but Tom Pro has been developed
and now she's giving feedback. Imagine
her giving feedback before it's been
developed.
>> Who knows? It could have already been
fixed back then.
>> Yeah.
>> The change that they're making now.
>> Yeah.
Generally not how I would do it.
>> I think the key thing um just from my
side, Adam, is that I would I would
never get a designer to like build out
full prototypes on a product they don't
understand. But what I might get them do
is service design. So just defining like
user needs to go from here to here just
little lines. Don't actually decide the
UI or anything.
>> Yeah, I don't mind if they do a mockup
in Figma or Photoshop or something and
you give gives it to you. It's going to
look a lot better than dev. But uh I
don't think that's what I was hearing
was happening.
Okay. Anyway, keep going.
>> All right.
gone back.
All right, moving on to the sprint
retro. So, what went well? Um, so yeah,
media indexing is looking promising when
investigating um how it works with
searching and pulling the uh collections
through or pulling the images through
into the media management. Um, yeah,
adding telemetry into branch sync to
investigate. I was very easy with Post
Hog compared to other telemetry
providers. Uh Brooks cleaning up some
PRs off to Benderbot. Uh the Tennessee
MSV4 uh Adam has agreed to. So we're
getting underway with uh the spec review
of that and some the search bugs that
were raised in Discord resolved quickly.
What didn't go so well? We had some uh
yeah with working with TSCMS
uh the tech debt is hurting the
velocity. Um and we had to revert a PR
to fix our regression.
>> Right. Um the other thing is I'm
slightly confused because it sounds like
B4 has been done and kind of working
given to a designer or we're doing a
spec review for it. Um
>> which is usually done before you've
started. It's been vibed up. It hasn't
been done.
>> Right. But when you vibe it up, was it
vibed up with specifications using clean
architecture or vertical slice
architecture?
>> No.
>> Is it vibed up in a bowl of mess?
>> Well, that's one of the things we have
to uncover.
>> Okay. We've seen we've seen a not not
even a a working product but a semi-
workinging product which just runs in
the client
>> just runs in the browser that's all.
>> Yep.
Okay.
>> With not all the things not all the
features done. It can't save. It can't
do a bunch of stuff but it's it's a
starting point.
>> Right. Has anyone looked at the prompts
that uh Jack used?
>> Not yet.
>> Where is where is Jack? Why is he in
this meeting? Is that a doctor's
appointment?
>> Has anyone looked at his prompts?
No.
>> I think that's critical. We look at
these prompts and maybe we get calm to
look at these prompts. But when I've
been watching other devs, they are a bit
more ill on their prompts. Maybe I don't
know what Jack's done, but
it can make it look like it it looks
nice and maintainable.
>> Well, that's why we
>> never take a
>> review the code
>> test. Yeah.
Regardless of how good the prompts are,
it's it's still a vibe coded proof of
concept.
>> Whether it was beautifully constructed
or not, I wouldn't put that into prod.
>> Oh, yeah. For sure. Yeah. Thanks for
what the code looked like and all the
prompts.
Okay.
Um, uh, Brooke, can I ask you to, uh,
call Jack and Callum together and have a
look through those two items?
Yeah. See if he's got his prompts and
see what Kum thinks of what it looks
like.
>> Cool. Thanks,
>> Moving on to the uh, sprint 91 forecast.
So our sprint goals is media management
improve the performance and um for the
rules project we need to uh implement
the reliable telemetry on our branding
corporations to see where uh time is
going to
for the backlog. Key items to note are
the media management uh PPIs that we
have and that telemetry PBI
to investigate the uh indexing process
performance
uh copilot stats. So the next item uh
main item to focus on is the media
management improvements and telemetry.
So yeah uh telemetry for the brain sync
operations. So yeah it was uh pretty
spot on with that one. Give that a tick.
Cool.
So, thank you all for attending this
meeting. Uh will be uploaded to the
Tennis CMS YouTube channel under the
sprint summaries playlist. Hope you all
enjoyed. Cheers.
>> Thanks.
