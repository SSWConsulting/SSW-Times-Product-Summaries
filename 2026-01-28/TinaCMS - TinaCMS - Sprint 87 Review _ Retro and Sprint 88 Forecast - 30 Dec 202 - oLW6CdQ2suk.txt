Hi all and welcome to the TINA cloud and
Tina CMS sprint 87 review and retro and
the sprint 88 forecast. First we'll be
going through the review.
So for uh sprint goal we had the new
search functionality which is still
unfortunately in progress. Uh Jack could
you speak to more speak more about that?
I absolutely can. So,
um, last week's or well, I guess this
week, um, after some talks with Eli and
the rest of the team, we wanted to make
there be a difference between kind of
the V1 search and V2. Um, so we've
refactored a bunch of bunch of stuff on
the V2 endpoint now to make it simpler
and just better um, dev experience.
We've also added um search config into
the TINA lock file now. Um and that's
being passed to Tina cloud on index. So
um it's just some stuff that we no
longer need to send across the wire. Um
and yeah, it's looking a lot better.
It's in uh review now. So
hopefully hopefully this is the the week
it goes in.
>> Sweet.
So for our spits uh we had 2,750
for the uh hours built to Tina cloud we
had 48 hours built to Brooke and myself
and for Tina CMS we had 36 hours built
to Ivonne Jack and Josh.
for the sprint backlog. Key things to
note were was the uh UI enhancement.
Um so this
was
just a request from one of the guys on
uh disc uh GitHub discussions uh was to
add a uh width specifier to our fields
so that we can wrap them on the same
line if need be. Um and that is all.
Yeah, ready ready to go in, ready to be
released.
Next is the uh add labels to the
collaborators list, which I'll get Brook
to speak about.
>> Yeah, this one actually came from you,
Adam. Um, we had a lot of duplication on
the users collaboration list where RO
and status was repeated a million times.
Um, so I've gone ahead and cleaned up
that on a couple of the other pages as
well to simplify it into a single
header.
Nice.
>> Moving down to our sprint burnup. We
have our zero remaining and seven
completed.
>> Uh sorry, before we move on, um was
anything done that helped the SSW rules
team?
Um,
no, nothing was done.
>> Did Did anyone spend any time talking to
any of those members to help them with
any issues?
>> No,
not the sprint.
>> And is so the only thing they care about
is the search thing at the moment?
Um, as far as I'm aware, that is u the
last thing they they spoke to at least
me about.
>> Um, so that's my understanding.
>> And Eli, you could say the same. There's
nothing else they want.
>> Yeah, there was nothing else.
>> Okay. All right.
Cool. For code coverage, uh, yeah, not
not yet logged. Production deployments,
we had one deployment for Tina Cloud and
one release for Tina CMS.
application health overview timeline. Uh
we have seen identity API 500s decrease
from 5 to 4 and content API 500s
decreased from 5K to 2K. Um yeah, so
because of the holidays, the the rules
team haven't been on. Um but I would
expected that to decrease a bit more
since there wasn't any um development
work going on in the rules team. So, I
think I'm going to I am going to
investigate that a bit more to see why
those uh errors are still quite high.
Any
>> um
>> did you did you notice from about the
23rd 24th that all the numbers are way
down uh because the Christmas break or
you don't see that
>> uh on the eras?
>> No, on general. Yeah, everything's down.
>> Every how how much would it would you
say down 10% or 30%. So like yeah 30
40%.
>> Could you could you after this mean just
measure that like give me this graph now
and the one you know a few weeks ago and
just so we can get a I'd just be
interested in
>> how much traffic went down.
>> Yeah. And at the end of the um the retro
we've got these uh package download
numbers. I can do it off there.
>> Okay. Well, yeah, I guess uh is that the
best way?
>> Uh would probably be the quickest way to
do it. Otherwise, I would have to yeah
go through the cloudatch and pull the
requests out and then the numbers based
off that. Um yeah,
>> because people could have automation
um grabbing stuff rather than looking at
traffic of visitors.
>> Yeah, they could. There might be some
stuff in Post Hog we could also have a
look at as well.
>> Yeah.
>> Um yeah, I can I can investigate into
it.
>> Yeah, just compare one week versus
another week.
>> Yep.
>> So issues opened and closed for Tennis
CMS. Uh last month we had 31 issues
opened and 12 closed. And this month we
have 15 opened and 14 closed.
passing over to Brooke.
>> Cool. Let's get into some of the fun uh
stats. So, as an overall over the last
seven days for organizations and project
creations, it's remained pretty much
flat. The trends lines show that it's um
flat. We can definitely see though in
the last couple of days, specifically
over Christmas, it did go down. Um
especially the organizations
uh or projects, they they went down, but
they are slowly making a rise back up
now that the holiday spirit's over. Um
so overall the trend line remains pretty
flat.
Uh we can see over the last uh 30 days
in terms of the organizations that
projects created. We can also see a
slight downward trend.
Looking at the user onboarding, we've
had a decrease of user onboarding from
8% to 6%. Um and the collaborator
remained at a stable 27%.
Looking at our onboarding experience um
we can see a general decrease into the
amount of uh onboarding experiences
being uh occurring. Um again this is
expected over the Christmas holidays.
The most important thing for us here is
the actors user which is our recommended
onboarding choice is still remaining
above as the primary chosen option which
is good to see.
Uh looking at the clones for this week
for the uh Barebones starters over the
last two weeks, sorry, we've had an
increase of clones from the Tina
Barebones and self-hosted um and a
slight decrease in the Tina NextJ
starter.
And you can definitely see here in the
total package downloads over the
Christmas period that we've had a
massive decrease um specifically from
37,000 to 18,000 which is quite large.
Um, but we suspect that it will come
right back up as soon as the Christmas
period is over.
In terms of the epic progress,
everything has remained pretty much
constant. However, we should have some
more um post hog um epic action coming
in in the following sprints as we
implement post hog into Tina CMS.
Uh there was some R&D work done with the
search bar. Jack, you want to speak to
that?
Yep. So, yeah, still chugging along with
the um search work. So, it's
implementing new ways to um store and
transfer data across the tiny cloud as
well as um figuring out how we want to
uh detect and
um index users content. So, uh some cool
stuff there.
>> Awesome. Uh moving on to the AI tools
used. We can see a lot of people are
using Yak Shaver and C-Pilot
specifically. We've got some Claude code
and GBT, but um yeah, GitHub C-Pilot,
Yaka, and Curs seem to be the primary
options chosen so far.
>> So, Brooke, you haven't been in any Yak
shaves.
>> No, cuz I was on client work only a
couple days ago. So, I've only just come
back onto internal.
>> Okay. And you're not using for client
work?
>> Uh, not for that project. No. Okay. All
right.
Um, in terms of the AI summary, we can
see that Eli did most of the talking
with uh Jack and I coming in
occasionally when needed.
According to AI, the main issue
completed was the update to date fields
and related types. Um, which is correct.
Eli, if you want to jump in. Oh, Jack,
sorry.
>> Cool. Uh, retro. So, what went well? Um,
I think we're all happy to see the the
cool new Post Hog stats for like a geo
based IP. Um, so we can see, you know,
where the traffic's coming from, America
or Australia.
Um,
we are also making some great progress
in Tina Cloud,
making the the UI there a bit more
snappy um and more modern, which is
awesome to see. um a lot more usable now
and [snorts] not as cluttered. Um and
then we also cleaned up some stale PRs
on the TNCMS side as well. So great
stuff overall. Um obviously the W didn't
go so well. Search search is still kind
of in progress. Uh it's back to being in
review again. So we'll hopefully get
that um in the next sprint.
>> Sweet. All right, moving on to the
forecast.
So the uh sprint goal for this sprint or
the next sprint is to finish off the
search functionality
and the uh backlog items for the next
sprint. Uh to note is the search
obviously our goal uh improving the
caching. This is a long outstanding item
that we need to get done to um resolve
those uh uh content API errors. And we
have the branch status update. Uh just
finishing off the video for that. And
the uh media management uh getting work
started on that which is great because a
lot of lot of uh complaints around to
the media manager. So, uh, co-pilot
stats,
what was the main item to do according
to AI? It was to, um, finish off the UI
enhancement for the half world width
field specifier. Um, not entirely. Uh, I
don't agree with that. I think it's more
the uh, what was the spring goal, which
was to get the um, uh, the search
functionality done, but yeah.
So, thank you all for attending. This
meeting will be uploaded to the TINA CMS
YouTube channel under the sprint
summaries playlist. Hope you enjoyed.
Cheers.
>> Thanks, Eli.
