Hi all and welcome to the Tina Cloud
Antenna CMS Sprint 88 review and retro
and the Sprint 89 forecast. First, I'll
be going through the review.
So, for our sprint goal, we have the new
search functionality.
Where we at, Jack?
Yeah. So,
um, this one's kind of been in in review
for a little bit. Um, just this week we
had a few more comments, um, for some
fixes. Implemented those. Um, so now
it's kind of been back in review.
Um, and yeah, still waiting a review.
Um, so hopefully
>> throw my name into it as well if you
want if you want to throw me under
[laughter] the bus.
No, Eli has been has been a great
reviewer and has been uh reviewing when
he can and yeah, putting good uh making
some good feedback and changes. So, uh
yeah, it's just it's coming along
hopefully hopefully this the sprint.
Okay, I feel like I'm having deja vu. Uh
did we give this priority or did other
things pop up or did somebody not give
enough focus to it? like what happened
and and in hindsight is there anything
that could have happened since that was
completed?
>> Um I guess the only thing um I guess we
could have been locked in a room
together
um or on a call
all all days while you know fixes and
stuff are happening. So, you know, there
is some blocking time in there, but um
yeah, that probably would have got it
across the line.
>> Yeah, I was trying to spend most of my
time on reviewing it. Um but there was
probably a little bit of downtime
between when Jack finished his uh his
reviewer comments, finished the reviewer
comments, and then when I went to
re-review it. Um, but yeah, there was a
there was a lot of back and forth
between review and that which kind of
blew it out the sprint.
>> Okay. In the last sprint, how many hours
did you spend together on a call?
>> Uh, you saying the sprint or the sprint
before?
>> Sprint. The sprint we're talking about
the last 5 days.
>> Yeah. Um,
I'd say
maybe 4 hours, maybe more.
>> Yeah, I would say four plus for sure.
>> So, I think you should have been
spending that per day on it together.
Like, if it's if it's the number one
focus and we've had the same problem
many times over,
>> yeah, it feels like you should be giving
it a good half a day every day until
it's done.
Yeah, I don't know if it was uh four
hours. It might have been more, but um
yeah,
>> just the way you the way you work and
you guys correct me if you disagree is
you're on a call together and you give
some feedback on some piece of code you
don't like and the other person is
fixing it as you're talking while you're
looking at the next thing.
>> Yeah. The only thing was that the
feedback that I gave it did take a bit
of time to fix it. So, it wasn't like we
could quickly fix it there on the spot.
It was like, "All right, I'll come back
to you when it's when it's all done."
>> Definitely. And that's some of the
bigger things, but there's lots and lots
[clears throat] of little things that
can be done together.
>> And you have the big chunk of work. And
yeah, if if Jack needs to do some
thinking and and some refactoring, it's
going to take a day or two, then so be
it. But
>> but that's not what it feels like
happened.
>> Yeah, there was a little bit of that.
Uh, and there was also a little bit of
um, yeah, we could have definitely
stayed on the call together to
streamline that process a bit.
>> Okay. Uh, Brooke, any comments from you?
>> No, I was focusing on other things such
as your email task, so I didn't get a
chance to comment on any of that stuff.
>> Okay. Well,
I think that this is a one that has been
going on for uh how many how many
sprints now, Jack, since we've done been
doing the search?
>> Uh I think four.
>> Think more.
>> Going on to five, I believe. Oh, maybe
more. [snorts]
>> Yeah. Uh, it's definitely been blocking
blocking the rules one from going live a
few a few times until they gave up on
waiting. [clears throat]
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. It definitely could have went in a
bit sooner if I wasn't too onto the the
reveal process, but I wanted to make
sure that it was, you know, in a good
state with what went in.
>> Oh, no. Uh, of course I'm I'm not
complaining about getting the quality
right. I'm just uh the focus just
doesn't seem like it's there
>> on this one.
>> And and that's kind of why I'm
mentioning you, Brooke. I know you're
working on other things, but if they're
not swarming and you can help in any
manner, I would prefer that we work on
the sprint goal. Number one, if
everybody in the team can help.
Yeah.
All right, let's move on. All
right, moving on.
For our spits, we had 4,000 uh this
week.
And Tencloud, we had 64 hours build to
Brooke and myself.
And for Tennis CMS, we had 48 hours
build to Jack and Ivonne.
for the sprint backlog. We don't have
anything too cool to to show, but yeah,
things worth mentioning was yeah, that
search is um there ready to uh finish
the last bit of review. Um the title
tags on all pages. Brooke, you want to
speak to that?
>> Yeah, so I put some work into updating
the title tags, which are the little
titles you see on the top of each tab.
Um, previously Tina Cloud, no matter
what tab you went to, it was always
saying just Tina Cloud. Um, but now they
are descriptive and tell you where
you're at in the page.
>> And this is useful for when you share a
page because this is what goes into the
subject of an email.
>> Cool.
And the improve caching optimize build
request handling Jack.
>> Yeah. So this was another SSW rules one
um [clears throat] well that we've
really noticed with SSW rules anyway.
It's been around for for quite a while.
Uh it's essentially cing build requests.
So
um I've I had a bit of investigation um
the sprint. I've now created five kind
of spike PBIS
um so that we can we can go in different
directions to see how we want to uh one
capture this information so through some
metrics and stuff like that uh because
we it's kind of an unknown at the moment
of you know do uh do our requests
actually use the C um you know sure sure
we can see we can we can you know guess
we can fill in the blanks because
they're not hitting our API
um you know what what is the the hit
rate and stuff like that um and then
also how we want to solve kind of the
the root issues and I've broken that
down into kind of four four items
um [snorts] so I guess the the biggest
the biggest one is
currently there's no cing overlap so
every time a new build is created we are
querying all content
again and on rules you know uh they
could be four PRs a day that's four
[clears throat] you know rebuilds of the
whole site um invalidating all cache
four times and reaching everything uh
which just isn't [snorts] really that uh
amazing um and we can definitely make
some strides to improve that
>> uh how much time did you spend on that
one, Joe?
>> Um, just in the downtime of my uh like
waiting for review and stuff like that.
So, maybe [clears throat and cough]
maybe eight hours in total,
>> right? Okay. And what is the downtime?
Waiting for feedback from Eli or what is
it waiting for builds or
>> Yeah, yeah, a bit of both. Like Tina
Cloud does take a while to to get up and
running. Um it's kind of kind of the
pain when building Tina CMS and Tin
Cloud. You know, you make a change in
Tina Cloud. I mean Tina CMS, then you
have to wait for that to build and then
>> test it. Yeah.
>> Is that one more technically interesting
than the search?
>> Um [clears throat]
I think so. Yeah, there's definitely a
lot more u optimizations that we can
that we can do there. Um,
>> right.
>> You know,
>> and do you feel like a a gravitational
pull to it that it's easier to work on
than the search?
>> Um, no, I wouldn't I wouldn't say that.
Um,
no. Search search is the the goal to get
that over the line, but it's just Yeah.
>> Okay.
>> Sweet. Moving down to the sprint burnup.
So there is 21 remaining and three
completed.
Code coverage not yet logged. Uh
production deployments we've had one
deployment for Tina cloud and one
release for Tennis CMS.
For the application health overview
timeline, um we have seen identity API
500s increase from 4 to 14 and the
content API HTTP 500s uh increased from
2K to 4K. So uh that increase in errors
there. Looks like the rules team is back
online and building their project which
is causing our content API errors to go
up. [sighs]
uh will there be any time spent on any
of those?
>> Uh are you going to look at reducing the
numbers on any of that
>> and if so which one can you highlight
which one you you would look at?
>> Yeah well the uh content API HP500s uh
we need to we are looking at and that's
around the caching investigation that
Jack's doing.
>> Which one is it?
>> That is the improved caching optimized
build is handling.
>> Which one on the charts? [clears throat]
It is the content [clears throat] API
errors. Um, which you can see
>> that one.
>> I don't know if you can see my cursor.
>> Yeah, just it's very small. But, uh,
that only looks like it's got two big
spikes.
>> Yeah. So,
>> is that you're trying to eliminate those
spikes, are you?
>> Yeah. That one big spike would be uh
when a when the rules project build ran.
Oh, I see.
>> Yeah,
>> that's not easy to repro, is it?
>> Um, well, yeah, Jack's I think Jack is
looking to reproduce it,
>> but um I don't think it is easy. No.
>> Okay. All right, cool.
>> Yeah.
>> Is open and closed for Oh, sorry. I seen
uh Sam, you had your hand up.
Oh. Uh, it's much smaller, but like the
identity API ones. Um,
>> yeah.
>> Do you know what they were?
>> Um, they're mostly around um GitHub
authorization tokens and it seems like
it's just uh yeah, it's coming from
GitHub. Like 500 responses come from
GitHub and then we're just uh rethrowing
that and there's yeah, don't think
there's too much that we can do around
that.
So issues open and closed for Tennis
CMS. Uh last month we had 18 issues
opened and 15 closed. And for this month
we had uh two issues opened and one
closed.
Passing over to Brook. Yes. Cool. So in
terms of organizations and projects
created over the last 7 days, we had an
increase from 65 to 79 which is awesome
to see. Um looking at the total looking
at the last month. So if you scroll down
here, this is the trend for the last
month of projects and organizations
created and we can see a slight down
trend. Um although it's still looking
pretty healthy.
In terms of user onboarding, we had an
increase of 6% to 10% of users making it
through the whole process. And then in
terms of the um users accepting invites,
we had 27% increase to 32% which is
awesome to see.
Uh in terms of people completing the
onboarding, it seems we've had a bit of
a decrease coming to the end of this
week, but things have remained pretty
stable. Um, what's good to see is that
the actors user, which is our
recommended choice, is still the primary
option being chosen here.
Um, in terms of unique cloners over the
last two weeks, we had a big decrease
almost by half in both the barebones
starter and the next year starter.
However, people see still seem to be
loving the self-hosted demo, which has
remained pretty constant.
Looking at the packages, uh the Tina CMS
package downloads for the week. We had a
pretty big increase from 18,000 to
26,000. Um we suspect this is due to
some of the Cena CMS releases. Um and a
lot of these stats going up could be a
sign of everyone coming back from the
Christmas period.
In terms of the epics, we had no
progress towards any of these.
looking at the R&D. Jack's spent some
work on the search bar if he wants to
speak more to that.
>> Um, yeah. So, I mean, I've kind of
already talked about it uh before, but
yeah, just refactoring how some of the
endpoints worked uh the sprint. Um,
yeah, and just stuff in review.
>> Sweet. In terms of the AI tools, most
people are still using some form of
C-pilot, Yak Shaver, and Claude Code.
Um,
people still seem to also be using
cursor, which is cool.
>> And Brooke, you definitely didn't get
involved in any yak shaves
>> in this last week.
>> Okay.
>> All right.
Uh, in terms of the speaking summary,
Eli did most of the speaking, which
makes sense. um with Jack, Ivan, and I
coming in as needed.
>> Yeah. We also think uh speaker one might
have been Ivonne's uh wife.
>> Oh, really? In the background.
>> Yeah.
>> Oh,
>> we think it might be able to pick it up
and recognize voices.
>> Really? [clears throat]
>> I'm sus on that, but
>> yeah. Well, we see it lined up. So, uh,
it could be
>> Do you think this is generated from the
transcript or do you think it's
generated from listening to specific
voices?
>> Well,
if uh if it was if it was his wife, then
I would say it would be voices. If it
wasn't, then yeah, probably transcript.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay, cool.
Uh the main action point it said was to
add labels to the collaborate list in
terms of things that were completed.
>> Um
>> is that accurate or not accurate?
Can you trust AI or not?
>> Uh
>> in terms I think that was one of the
main things we did. Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. So it's accurate. Okay. Now, what
I'd like you to do, um, before we get to
the retro, can you click on the link
that Callum has just sent through? He
just threw it into Claude
>> and he's going to give you some
uh let's have a quick look at this. He
he's just thrown the transcript in. So,
that's all he's done. And you can see
there's four participants and they did
four things. So, uh, scroll down a
little.
Uh, it's kind of worked out that there's
three parts of this. Scroll up a touch.
Yep. There was a premeating chat where
you talked about hockey and ice skates
and then there's a sprint review which
you talked about search and post hog and
then you did a sprint planning. So, it's
all worked this out from the transcript.
You know, maybe you said let's start the
sprint planning. I don't know. But it's
worked it out. And
>> was there a retro in there?
Uh, no. There was no retro. So, you must
have done the retro when after you
stopped recording.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. Interesting. Good. And then scroll
down to the speaking time.
>> Based on not listening to anything, just
looking at the transcript, Eli talks the
most, then Jack, then Brooke, then
Ivanne, which is different from the
other thing which uh was counting Ivan's
wife in the background.
Um so discussion topics it says
well you mostly talked about cing and
search and then image uploads and then
Adam's email tasks and then post hog and
repo and support tickets. Okay
the next bit
and
it's talking about the people that
weren't there. I don't know how it works
this out. How could it work out who
wasn't there?
must have been referred to a bunch of
times, I guess.
>> Did you guys talk about that?
>> Yes. Yes, we did.
>> Oh, wow.
>> This is actually really cool. Like that.
That's a pretty good summary.
>> That's unbelievable. It's worked out.
Who's not there? Okay.
>> Um Ben or Ben? Who's Ben? Ben Neo,
right?
>> Ben was probably how I called him.
[laughter]
>> Yeah, it's probably your
Kiwi accent. That was hilarious. And
then it said completed this sprint.
Well, you got these half like imagine
sending this to a client. So this is
what we did this week. Half width
speaker specify added labels to the
collaborator list. Branch status and
repo cleanup. And we're blocked with
Matt being away,
Adam reviewing the branch status video,
Ivan's next sprint allocation, and Cloud
Front.
Is that Cloud Flare?
>> No, Cloud Front. CloudFront's uh cloud
flare of AWS.
>> Oh, right. Okay. All right. All right.
Keep going.
>> Okay. Just go to the top. Is there
anything else interesting there, Colin?
>> Click on rolls and see if it works out.
Who's who?
Uh, it thinks Eli is a scrum master
based on what he's doing. He drove
entire meeting agenda. So that's
probably a scrum master. Jack is a
developer
and u it notices he's got deep technical
explanations of cing
but issues are cing work deferred for
spikes. The original PBI was unclear.
And then Brooke is a developer and he's
working on seven email tasks from Adam
and issues noticed post hog not done
prioritize for Adam's email task. Pretty
good summary work invisible in sprint
and Ivan what's he doing? Let's have a
look.
Ivan is completing the repo cleanup 35
repos to delete provided context on
cloudfront cing and PR sent for
approval. Hopefully uh Ivan when you
sent the PRs did you call the person to
get it approved or you just threw it
over the fence?
>> Uh I sent it to Brook. He couldn't
review them, so I sent him to the common
chat and today I was going to chase
someone about it.
>> I finished up on the PR.
>> You got to find somebody.
>> Yesterday.
>> Yeah. Okay. But it's important that you
find someone and you do it together.
Yeah. Don't Don't throw it into the chat
and kind of throw it over the fence.
Yeah. Work with somebody. Um may or may
not be on Tina's next sprint. Okay. If
you're not sure about that, you should
definitely be calling me or Benchmaster.
Yeah, the I was going to call you after
this to figure out what happens next.
>> You would try to call before, not after
cuz it's important for the planning.
Yeah. So, yeah, you know, uh you know,
on soon as you on your way to work, just
text me and say you'll be calling as
soon as you get to work or whatever. Um
but yeah, get this done before you
start. All right. Uh keep going down.
Major role issues identified. No
retrospective. Oh, wow. PO is absent.
Uh, it thinks I'm the PO. It doesn't
know Matt's the PO just from the way
you're talking. Keep going down.
Shadow work. Brook sprint largely
invisible.
Uh, okay. Maybe I should be sending
doing all those as Jack shaves Brooke,
but I think I attempted to, but you were
unavailable.
>> Um, so I just sent emails. U Ivon's next
sprint is unclear.
Uh, yeah. Okay. Good, good, good. Uh,
anything else there, Colin, that you
think's interesting?
>> I'm not sure. I haven't actually looked
at it closely. I just generated this and
then jumped in with me.
>> Uh, what's dynamics?
>> Team dynamics. It looks like
>> you have strong technical depth, but
there's not strong decision authority.
Just looking at that. So, uh, but
there's pretty good meeting engagement,
especially by is it Brooke or Eli? Not
what color is that? Eli Eli has strong
meeting engagement
and Jack has strong technical depth
based on this. Yeah. Very very cool.
Uh
yeah. And then look, it thinks that Eli
is the central facilitator and Jack's
the technical leader and Brook's a
status reporter and Avan is a technical
collaborator.
Very clever based on just a transcript.
>> Super cool. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Thanks, K. That was that was fun.
And how complicated was your prompt?
>> Uh, it was just one sentence that said,
"Generate a cool dashboard based on this
transcript."
>> So, yeah, you can imagine what what he
could have got had he said, "Now, look
out for your weaknesses or give critical
feedback or anything like that." It
would it would probably be giving you
harsher feedback or something.
>> Should you point it towards like a ECW
rule or
>> Nope. No. Okay.
>> Just the one sentence. That's all it
took. But yeah, you can imagine, as Adam
said, how good you can make it if if you
did put some effort into the prompts.
>> For sure. [snorts]
>> You get a standardized template and
stuff like that.
>> It's better than Copart.
>> Yeah, it is.
>> The only reason The only reason I tried
it is because yesterday Copilot was
broken. So, I thought, why don't we give
Claude a go? And then it actually did a
much better job.
Yeah.
>> Nuts.
>> Great.
>> All right.
>> More.
All right.
So, ready to get into the sprint
retrospective.
>> Jack, take it away.
>> Cool. So, what went well? Uh Avon has
gone through all the CVES to do with
Reacts and all of that and has fixed
them among the like 90 repos that we
currently have. Um which is awesome
work. Um yeah, stuff's in review. We'll
we'll look at that. Um Eli said the
search is looking good, especially with
the new changes from the sprint. So
hopefully again we'll get that in uh
this coming sprint. What didn't go so
well?
Um, Brook said Adam is sending email
related tasks as or sending tasks as
emails instead of making them as PPIs,
check shaves, etc. Uh, maybe we can see
how that can go. Um, and then for
>> just on that,
>> yep,
>> Brooke, do you know there's a rule
>> on turning an email into a PBI?
>> Yes. I feel like at the point of writing
the email, it might have also just been
easier if you jumped into the cloud repo
and wrote up an issue in the same email
format and then that avoids the
duplication work there.
>> Yes, that's that's correct. Um, but if
you do get one from a client or from
Discord, you've still got to do it.
>> Yep.
>> Yeah, maybe that's something you
actually could do.
I thought there was some work for
>> turning emails into PBIS. Anyway,
>> we did something about that on uh
brainstorming for Yak Shaver, but it's
not we did we didn't take it any further
than a proof of concept.
>> Do you know who did it?
>> Yeah, me.
>> Oh, [laughter]
okay. Next next task for you after the
search. Don't get don't get any ideas.
right now. I had Okay, cool. Um, cool.
Uh, improvements.
Um, we're seeing some more community
contributors making PRs, which is really
cool to see. Um, but I'm seeing a lot of
them are having troubles running the
project. Um, and that's because in
outside of our monor repo, we've got
this examples folder and we've also got
this experimentals examples folder. And
they're very out of date and most of
them don't work. Uh, so we're going to
clean them up. We've already had a PBI
for this in previous sprints, but it
kind of got pushed back due to other um
urgent matters, but I think we should
just delete them and maybe update the
docs on how to get some good examples.
>> Is that something you could look at,
Eva?
>> Sure. Yeah. Okay.
>> Yep. Yeah, that' be that' be awesome.
Um, and then also we're having some PRs
that are, you know, the turnaround time
is is kind of long. Um, so maybe we
should, you know, after daily, everyone
should just, uh, have a look at some PRs
to review. Um,
uh, etc.
>> Yeah. Uh, Ivan, if you're having
problems with this, please go to Sam and
get some advice so that you can get past
this. But basically, you've got like
everybody's busy. You just kind of got
to be semi putting yourself forward and
interrupting people and being uh
slightly more aggressive.
>> Yes, Sam.
>> Oh, I was just going to suggest exactly
the same thing with PRs. So, I won't say
that again, but the other thing is that
it's really good to as a team make an
agreement that done code is infinitely
more valuable than in inflight code.
Inflight code is worth nothing because
it doesn't do anything. PR code that
could actually go in is worth
everything. So like fundamentally
whatever you're touching right now
doesn't matter unless it's an like an
actual bug fix or something like a hot
fix.
So if someone asks for a PR review, you
should put everything down and do it.
>> Agreed.
>> You have to agree to that as a team
though. Just saying.
>> Yeah.
>> All right. So moving on to the uh sprint
89 forecast. So our sprint goal, same
thing. New search functionality. Let's
get it done. And for the forecast,
um we just
>> uh sorry, could we also put put there
for to get those uh uh I think I would
like since everyone's going to be
getting SSW rules on Tina now. I really
think there should be a focus on the
orth or any getting started stuff. Each
person to edit a rule at the moment is
going to go through the orth procedures
have to get their account done. It seems
crazy to me when you know the single if
a company signs up for single sign on it
feels like it they should be instantly
in and it sends them an email something
like that. They shouldn't have to go
through this sugaring procedure to ask
for stuff. it feels very very
>> full of friction and it doesn't feel
like they're an SSO customer, you know,
and I think that is my number one issue
that people are going to have a bad
first experience of the orth and it
doesn't make you love Tina.
Okay, so they get to the OR, it doesn't
work. They need to know to go to sugar
learning, follow a procedure, then they
do the right thing and then they get in.
I would say to you, even if you go right
now to the off screen, you're not sure,
even though you've come in from rules
that you're meant to be using SSO,
you would click on that GitHub button
just as easily as the other as entering
your email address. Um I think that work
is really high priority.
>> Anything? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Just set
that as a string goal to focus on
authentication and signup issues.
Cool. Uh yeah, things to note for our
backlog obviously the search. Um we are
also looking at image upload and
deletion messages. Um, proof caching is
a big one for us uh to get that uh
looked at uh decreasing those content
API errors and
um yeah, that's about it. Just finishing
off the the work that was left over from
last sprint.
>> Yeah, add add an one in there um before
you press send on this today.
Okay, I'll need to take take one off
just cuz we are at capacity. Um
yeah, I I'll have a look at that after.
I'll
>> Okay,
>> I might just take off the media
management then
>> for myself.
>> Uh is that media management that error
that Jack saw with Michaela? Okay,
where's that one?
>> That one is the top one. Image upload
and deletion error messages.
>> Okay, definitely Bob. That's uh
uh I guess uh it's it's only happens
when you drag and drop. Is that right?
>> No, it's not drag and drop. Okay.
>> Yeah, it seems like a
different kind of error just in general.
Uh I some people there were some people
really surprised by Michaela's error
because people like Jean and and Hugo
said we tested uh all that stuff and I
never saw it. I never dragged and
dropped but I didn't see any errors with
uploading images.
>> Yeah. Uh yeah, me and Ivan believe it's
something related to
>> Oh, okay.
>> which could be the reason why they
didn't see it in the first place.
>> Okay, got it.
>> Thanks. Anyway, moving on. Uh, copilot
that. Um, next main item to implement um
is the new search functionality. So,
yeah, pretty spot on with that one.
Um, cool.
So, thank you all for attending. This
meeting will be uploaded to the Tina CMS
YouTube channel under the sprint
summaries players. Hope you enjoyed.
Cheers.
>> Thanks everyone. See you.
