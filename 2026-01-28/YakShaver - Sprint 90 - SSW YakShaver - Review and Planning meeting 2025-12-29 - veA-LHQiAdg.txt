Hello everyone. This is Yaka spring
review number 90. Um, this is holiday
season, so we just only have few team
members present. So, let's jump into
what we've done this week.
So um our goal from
our goal from last week was to create an
on boarding wizard for desktop app and
that's done. Um and the second goal is
to get someone else outside of Yaka team
to start Canary testing. That's not done
yet, but the whole app is ready to be
tested.
Yeah, that on boarding wizard was the
main issue blocking uh a lot of people
from passing it. So now we have it.
We're ready to move on.
>> Right.
>> Thank you.
>> And here's the time sheet. Um this is
not up to date. I'll update the time
sheet after this meeting.
And let's jump into the details. So
we've got two main um PPIs.
One is the thought process no longer
shown in execute task panel. Um we used
to have AI thinking process steps in in
the log. Um however that was dis that
disappeared but now Louis has fixed it.
So now we can see all the chain of
thoughts from the AI.
And the second important ones is the
onboarding wizard. So that makes the
user sign up process a lot smoother. Um
so it's a guided three-step wizard. So
people can just click next, next, next
and they are done.
Um any questions, Adam?
>> Uh is there a done video of that new
wizard?
>> Not at the moment, but I'll get Tino to
do a done video for that. Um, Tino is
only working a few days last week, so he
didn't have time to do the Dundy.
>> Uh, could anyone else have jumped in and
done it for him?
>> Um,
>> I'm not sure.
>> Yes.
>> How How can you be not sure, Rick?
But
>> I think Tino is back next week.
Yes, but knowing he jumped off and this
is the final thing and you want
feedback. The most important thing of
the sprint review is to gather feedback,
>> right?
>> A done video would be awesome because
you quickly see what the experience is
like,
>> right? Yeah. I guess someone else could
record it for him. But during the
spring, we have um
another major bug came out from
Microsoft CI/CD pipeline. So me and
Steven were jumping to to look into the
issues because that's more important.
So we couldn't we were spending our time
looking to the CI/CD pipelines.
If that didn't happen, yeah. Uh, someone
else could do a dumb video for Tina.
>> And who would have probably done that?
>> Um, I would love to. Um, maybe Willow or
Steven would do it as well.
>> Okay. All right. Cool.
>> Yep.
Next. Um,
co- coverage.
Uh, we are, uh, co- coverage. It didn't
change. We we stay at 28%.
And I'll get Stephen to do the
deployments.
>> Yep. Thanks Rick. Um so from last sprint
we had three production release for
teams app and 12 uh production release
for the desktop app. Uh that's is that
is a lot considering uh most of us were
on the holiday
and uh for the
application health we had a 100%
availability.
Um although we can see a little bit
server response time uh pick up during
the beginning and the end of the weekend
that was because uh the server was on
co- starting some uh we have a user
doing shades during the weekends that's
why it caused a co- starting and we see
these two picss on the response time
otherwise uh the entire healthy
And um
>> do you think in the UI when that happens
we should say um like some little emoji
like the cold emoji or something so that
people realize oh it kicked open now?
>> Uh no I don't think so
>> really. Okay. Uh well, look, it's it's
uh if you look at that graph, the
difference is 200,
>> it's a bit hard to see, but 200
milliseconds to 800 milliseconds. And
that's on the the Yak Shaver Teams app
where you can't really see what it's
doing anyway. So, I'm not sure if the
the value that would be added by having
a a snowflake emoji indicate it's taking
an extra 600 milliseconds in a in a pro
process that already takes, you know,
many many seconds already. Like that's
going to be a negligible difference
really.
>> True. I agree.
>> And and actually, if you zoom out, you
can see on the 30-day graph, there was
actually a massive spike some time ago.
and and these spikes that look big on
the 7-day graph are actually tiny
compared to that. Um, so that's that
shows the value of the 30-day zoom out,
doesn't it?
>> Those spikes actually aren't that big
after all. If they were like 10 seconds
extra or something, then maybe it
wouldn't make sense.
>> Yeah. And uh for the leaderboard uh for
the past week we had no I mean for the
past uh 30 days we has we have Josh on
the top of the leaderboard and followed
by Jeffrey and Thiago.
By the way this this leaderboard still
looks Is it just me or when I see Josh
six shaves plus 23
I'm like how does that work? And I
remember I have to look over on the
right to see is actually 29.
Is it just me or or should the number
below Josh be the current number of
shaves and not what he did last time?
>> Does anyone else have the same issue I
have or is it am I unique in in my
reading of the of the information?
>> Um
I'm not sure. I feel I feel it's uh
normal to me. It's like Josh had a six
shave uh in in the previous uh window
and had a 23 increase.
>> Yeah, but there's such a a visual
difference between Josh plus 23 and then
all the way on the other side 29.
>> I think that should all just be
compressed
>> together so you don't have to look all
over the place.
Yeah, we can uh talk to designer and see
if we can improve this visual effect.
>> Sure.
>> Okay. Uh any questions?
>> Otherwise, I'll uh hand back to Rick.
So next we'll get uh Willow to talk
about the road map.
>> Yeah sure. So for the road map our
progress is 90% now as we have 2% ch
improvement and we have also some
changes for the portal UIUX improvements
that's 3% increase and we have also for
some increasement for the client portal
reporting. Yeah, that's for the road
map. Now we can scroll down to see the
the backlog stat. And so 31
of 35 they are um 31 they are labeled
with sex shaver and we got the um 21
completed that's plus 14 net change. And
for the desktop, we got 87% of them
labeled.
Yeah, that's pretty high. And for the
R&D part, there's no R&D part involved
during this week. And also for AI tools,
>> sorry, back on that stuff.
>> Yeah. Um I wonder um Callum if it would
be a good idea to have uh a menu item in
Yak Shaver that gives you this text
rather than using that backlog sprint
tool thing whether we should incorporate
it in
>> in Yaksha is in it like the teams chat
or
>> teams chat I'm thinking of going to the
portal and looking at a particular
project and then it gives you this so
you could just copy it out of there.
>> Yeah. Uh potentially.
>> Okay. Um uh Rick, can you gave that
after this meeting?
>> Sure.
>> Okay. Um so for AI tools, Steven has
used Gemini 3 this week.
>> We should bold bold the different ones.
That's what we normally do.
>> Is that the only one?
>> Yeah, that's the only changes for AI
tools.
>> Yeah. And then for the tenants stats, um
we can you scroll down a little. Yeah,
thank you. So we got um
43
talents this week there. We we have one
new talent, but
yeah. And then we have 19 shapes for the
teams and five for the MCP. Because of
the holiday, I think there's not that
much saves.
Yeah. Okay, that's all. I'll hand back
to Rick.
All right. So, next section is the cop
pallet stats and Colin's going to walk
us through this.
>> Yep. So it looks like Rick in his
capacity as standin scrum master did the
majority of the talking. Callum as
product owner I guess is second. That's
me. Steven uh was third and Willow in
fourth place. Uh and obviously only four
people this week. Sort of a skeleton
crew. Uh what was the main item that was
completed?
Of course being brief. We're zooming all
over the page so I don't know where we
are. Um, the main item was the
onboarding wizard for the desktop app,
which is very exciting and a much
demanded feature. So, we're glad we got
that in there. Um,
and that's it. Sprint retrospective. Uh,
looks like it was mostly a Callum
retrospective.
Uh, I said the wizard is a good
addition. Uh, a lot of the small bugs
that I mentioned recently have been
actioned very quickly, which is awesome.
and we are ready to obviously get
someone outside the team to test and
Willow agreed with that. Uh what didn't
go well? So Stephen mentioned that
Microsoft delivered us a Christmas gift
in the form of an Azure CLI bug that
broke the deployment pipeline. Uh but
that was swiftly corrected by the team.
Adam, did you want to add?
>> Uh sorry, is that a long-term
bug? Like is that a change in direction
for Microsoft or
>> it was b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b
b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b
b b b basically a breaking change in uh
one of the command line outputs. So we
just had to adopt adapt to the new
output.
>> Oh, okay. So I think that you should put
there it's fixed, Rick. Just put in
brackets um fixed
>> because it sounds like Yes, cuz it is no
longer a problem, but it was Yeah. How
much time did it How much time did it
eat?
Anyone
know
>> how much time did it take to fix or
>> Yeah. Well, yes. How much time did it
take to fix?
>> Um, about one or two days.
>> Oh, okay. And were you unhappy with the
way Microsoft um delivered that change?
>> Yes, very unhappy. It's it's it's
a bug and it broke
>> everyone's pipeline, I guess.
everyone
>> in the world.
>> Yeah, I think almost.
>> And did did you read any of the threads
on it? Should uh should we report it
back to Microsoft?
>> There there's already a issue open issue
on on the GitHub repo.
>> Right. Okay.
All right.
>> I wonder if we could try using Yak
Shaver to put an issue on on the
Microsoft repo.
>> Maybe
>> we should. Yeah, we should uh we should
do that soon.
>> Yeah.
>> Anyway, carry on. Um I mentioned it is
difficult to do the sprint meetings
properly without Lewis and Tom. Um
because Lewis has some special knowledge
about the uh app insights dashboard and
Tom has some special knowledge about the
tenant stats. Although Steven was able
to figure out the tenant stats and I
guess we as a team figured out the other
stuff. uh but there is a bit of
knowledge locked up in their heads. Uh
maybe we need to improve the email
template with some more links or improve
how we get the tenant stats or something
like that. Um for what needs to improve,
I mentioned that the wizard uh could be
more user friendly if it had check boxes
where you can just say tick to add
GitHub MCP cuz currently you need to
type in all the GitHub MCP configuration
but it's always the same for everyone.
uh if you're using the oorthth version
because you don't actually put your
credentials in there. You just give it
the URL. So I think we can make it even
easier if you just tick a box to add it
and then you don't have to actually type
anything at all.
>> Is there already a yak shave for that or
>> there is I yak shaved it mid sprint
planning so it'll be next sprint.
>> All right. So Rick could you add the
link on that underneath that before send
>> and also add one more point after this
which is someone on the team should have
had a discussion with Tino to ask you
know can one of us do the done video for
your thing so we can show it the sprint.
Yes, good point. Because the wizard is
obviously a very important piece of UX
since it was blocking all the canary
testing.
Everyone wants to see it.
>> Yep. Great.
>> All right. So that's all for the
retrospective
before we jump into the planning.
Okay. So next week our goal is still to
get someone outside of Yaka team to
start canary testing.
And
um here are the
PBIS that we
pull from last spring. So those were
pending
in review in progress and most important
ones is this one can testing. And then
there are a few things that um Callum
shaved in the middle of the spring and
as he mentioned uh there's we should add
preset MCP server for on boarding
checklist
and there's also other PBIS to improve
the UI and UX of the onboarding
experience.
Any questions Adam?
No, all good.
>> All good. All right. So, from AI's
uh analysis, the next priority is to
address the MCP server on boarding
checklist feature. I think that's pretty
spot on. Um yeah, so once we got that
done, um the Canary testing testing
should be more smooth now.
Cool.
And this video will be uploaded to our
YouTube channel and we will see you next
time.
>> Thanks Rick. Thanks guys.
>> Thank you.
